## Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer**  
<a>BYJU'S · Full-time</a>   
May 2021 - Present · 2 yrs 3 mos  
The knowledge tracing model developed by Byju's, called BADRI (Byju's Attentive Date2vec Rasch Implementation), is a sequential-to-sequential (seq2seq) model that utilizes the dataset of student interactions. BADRI incorporates the student's history of interactions to provide personalized learning content recommendations for specific objective components. This model aims to enhance the learning experience by tailoring the content to individual student needs based on their past interactions.
